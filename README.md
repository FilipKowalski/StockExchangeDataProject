# StockExchangeDataProject
This was a big first year project that we wrote as a team of 4 using java and the processing library, it includes many features but mainly focuses on the categorisation and visualisiation
of stock exchange data from past years.

This project took several months to complete and was a great learning experience in working as a team, i feel that my communication skills and teamwork skills greatly
improved during the course of this project.
